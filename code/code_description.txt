Maximum: The Twitter Search API currently does not allow more than the last 3200 posts for each timeline
Each line represents a party, each line follows the same scheme:
(1) federal party account
(2) faction of party in the Bundestag
(3) candidates from official candidate list

5. Data II - User-Generated Discussions
The seeds for relevant hashtags are mainly derived from the "Das Social Media Dashboard zur Bundestagswahl 2021",
a real-time social media dashboard made by the German newspaper "Tagesspiegel" in cooperation with
Democracy Reporting International and sponsored by the Mercator Foundation.
The dashboard gives information which hashtags are most oftenly used by the parties' lead candidates (1) and
which hashtags are most oftenly used mentioning the parties lead candidates (2) on Twitter.
The hashtags were firstly collected on September 2nd for the first collection of data.
